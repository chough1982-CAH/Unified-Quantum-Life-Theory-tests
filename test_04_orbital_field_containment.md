# UQLT Test 04: Orbital Field Containment via EMN Lock

## Test Title:
Orbital Resonance and Field-Lock Behavior in EMN‑Bound Systems

## Objective:
To test the UQLT claim that **orbital behavior** arises from electromagnetic-nucleic (EMN) field containment and resonance lock—not from gravitational attraction.

## Hypothesis:
Bodies remain in orbit when locked within a **field containment shell** emitted by an active fusion core (e.g., star or planet). In the absence of such fields, orbital coherence deteriorates. Valignity and EMN curvature, not mass-to-mass pull, dictate stability.

## Methodology:
1. Model or simulate systems with and without active EMN field cores:
   - Earth–Moon–Sun
   - Jupiter’s moons
   - Exoplanet systems

2. Observe orbital stability and phase lock behavior in:
   - Systems with known magnetic/electric emissions
   - Systems lacking strong EM field cores

3. Compare:
   - Resonance-lock distances
   - Phase coherence
   - Breakdown events (e.g., orbital drift when EM source weakens)

## Equipment / Tools:
- Orbital mechanics simulator (NASA data, n-body simulation tools)
- EM field data overlays (e.g., magnetic maps, field flux estimates)
- Spectral/phase lock observation data

## Prediction:
- Orbits align to EMN field boundaries
- Breakdown of field = orbital instability
- Moon/planet orbit distances correspond to EM resonance nodes

## Result Utility:
- Validates Valignity/Containment theory
- Refutes Newtonian gravity as primary cause of orbital lock
- Supports field-based orbital stability models
