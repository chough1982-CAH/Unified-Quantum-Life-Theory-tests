# UQLT Test 05: Fusion Decay Product Pathways

## Test Title:
Helium-to-Hydrogen Decay Validation in Fusion Core Systems

## Objective:
To test the UQLT claim that **hydrogen and deuterium are fusion byproducts**, not primordial fuels. The goal is to trace the production pathways of light elements from helium decay in high-energy fusion environments.

## Hypothesis:
In fusion-core systems (e.g., stars, reactors), helium accumulation leads to decay processes that **produce hydrogen and deuterium** — inverting the standard model which treats hydrogen as the starting point for fusion chains.

## Methodology:
1. Analyze product yields from:
   - Controlled nuclear fusion reactions (e.g., tokamak, stellarator, inertial confinement)
   - Spectroscopic data from stellar coronae or flare events

2. Detect and isolate:
   - Helium abundance trends over time
   - Emergent hydrogen or deuterium quantities following fusion pulses

3. Compare against standard models:
   - Does helium decay precede hydrogen spike?
   - Are decay pathways consistent with UQLT’s containment-collapse interpretation?

## Required Data/Tools:
- Access to controlled fusion experiment logs (e.g., ITER, NIF)
- High-resolution spectroscopy tools
- Temporal helium–hydrogen abundance tracking datasets

## Prediction:
- Hydrogen/deuterium **increase** during post-fusion cooling phases
- Fusion loop behaves as: radiation → helium → decay → hydrogen
- Fusion core systems recycle helium into light elements, not vice versa

## Result Utility:
- Validates UQLT’s helium-loop model and decay-driven fusion pathway
- Challenges Big Bang hydrogen primacy
- Clarifies elemental cycling in active fusion systems
