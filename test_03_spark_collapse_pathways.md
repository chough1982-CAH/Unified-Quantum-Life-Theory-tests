# UQLT Test 03: Spark Collapse Pathway Validation

## Test Title:
Spark Displacement and Collapse Path Selection in Open vs Contained Systems

## Objective:
Demonstrate that energy collapse in a spark event does **not** default to direct conductive grounding, but instead selects collapse resolution through **global containment** or field-based pathways, supporting UQLT's containment-prioritized collapse model.

## Hypothesis:
In systems where standard grounding is available but not preferential, sparks resolve collapse via indirect or unexpected paths due to nested containment mechanics.

## Methodology:
1. Use a torch lighter or spark gap generator in varied conditions:
   - Open air
   - Near conductive surfaces (metal)
   - Near isolated contained volumes (metal shell, foil ball, or Earth-grounding)

2. Observe spark path and jump behavior:
   - Directional preference
   - Whether spark avoids immediate conductor
   - Whether spark terminates in air or redirected path

## Required Equipment:
- Torch lighter or spark generator
- Grounded conductive plates
- Insulated platforms
- Faraday cage/metal volume (optional)

## Prediction:
- Spark avoids immediate grounding in favor of collapse toward distant containment boundary.
- Spark often arcs back toward the ignition source or loop path.
- Indicates **collapse-resolution**, not conduction-based escape.

## Result Utility:
- Validates UQLT spark-collapse laws
- Refutes purely conductive spark path assumptions
- Shows real-world evidence for collapse-driven resolution
