TEST TITLE:
Empty-Box Collapse Origin Test

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To test whether structured systems can emerge from an initially empty domain
using only UQLT-defined laws, without importing gravity, expansion, or external
initial conditions.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Grid initialized to EMPTY state
- No mass, no gravity, no spacetime curvature
- Only UQLT rules active:
  • Energy accumulation
  • Helium threshold (ℋ)
  • Collapse rule
  • Containment formation

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Energy accumulates locally due to rule-based propagation.
2. When energy exceeds ℋ, state transitions to HELIUM.
3. Helium concentration triggers inward collapse.
4. Collapse produces a stable containment node (core).

OBSERVED RESULT:
- A single dominant core forms spontaneously.
- Surrounding structure organizes around the core.
- System does not remain homogeneous.
- Collapse is inward, not explosive.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Structure emerges without pre-existing mass.
✔ Collapse precedes order.
✔ A core forms before shells.
✔ No expansion is required.

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Big Bang expansion necessity
✘ Gravity as a primitive cause
✘ Random uniform persistence

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- No core forms
- Collapse disperses outward
- Structure requires injected mass or tuning

STATUS:
PASSED
