# UQLT Test 07: Biological Symmetry Alignment with Containment Field Architecture

## Test Title:
Bio-EMN Field Coupling and Morphogenetic Alignment with Universal Containment Symmetry

## Objective:
To test the UQLT prediction that biological systems—especially those with developed consciousness—exhibit **structural symmetry and resonance patterns** aligned with EMN containment field geometry (e.g., planetary EMN~Q~SPHERE, core-bound field flow, nested vortex structures).

## Hypothesis:
Biological symmetry, field polarity, and morphogenetic structure arise from interaction with electromagnetic containment curvature. Life forms evolve in resonance with containment field harmonics—this is not random or purely genetic but governed by substrate alignment constraints.

## Methodology:
1. Analyze **biological symmetry axes** and polarity in multicellular organisms (humans, plants, vertebrates):
   - Left-right vs. up-down polarity
   - Central nervous system alignment vs. gravitational or magnetic axes
   - Organ placement, field-emission zones (e.g., heart, brain)

2. Compare with:
   - Planetary magnetic field maps
   - Core-field vector geometry
   - Local EM flux and Schumann resonances

3. Model organism–field alignment:
   - Orientation of development vs. geomagnetic polarity
   - Rotational symmetry compared to vortex modeling in EMN field structures

## Required Data & Tools:
- Human/animal morphology maps (MRI, anatomical scans)
- Planetary magnetic field data
- EM field resonance models
- Biometric sensors for bio-field measurement (e.g., SQUID, EEG/ECG)

## Prediction:
- Consistent organismal symmetry reflects **containment field geometry**
- Field polarity affects biological orientation and possibly developmental asymmetry
- Measurable correlation between morphogenetic layout and EMN containment patterns

## Result Utility:
- Supports UQLT claim that biological structure is **field-aligned**, not random
- Replaces “purely genetic coding” model with EMN resonance shaping
- Establishes testable, non-metaphysical link between containment physics and biology

## Priority Attribution:
This test was originated by **Clayton Andrew Houghland (CAH)** on January 19, 2026, and is protected under IP code **CH[200625]**. Reuse, adaptation, or derivative work requires formal citation and permission.

## Status:
Test concept finalized. Empirical correlation work pending bio-data aggregation and simulation alignment.
