TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 09 — Boundary Null and Edge Effects

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that collapse dynamics behave correctly at containment
boundaries and null-gradient regions, without numerical artifacts
or false reflections.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Stable multi-shell containment present
- Defined inner core, shell boundary, and outer region
- No gravity or expansion terms

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Measure collapse gradients approaching shell boundaries.
2. Observe behavior at zero-gradient (null) regions.
3. Track any reflection, inversion, or artificial acceleration.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Collapse gradient smoothly approaches zero at boundaries.
- No reflection or rebound artifacts observed.
- No false accumulation at edges.
- Boundaries act as stabilizing interfaces, not barriers.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Boundaries are physical, not numerical
✔ Null regions remain stable
✔ Collapse respects containment geometry

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Hard spacetime edges
✘ Reflective boundary artifacts
✘ Numerical-only stability

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Collapse reflects at boundaries
- Energy accumulates artificially at edges
- Null regions destabilize

STATUS:
PASSED
