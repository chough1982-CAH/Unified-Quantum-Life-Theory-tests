TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 03 — Primary Containment Stability

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To test whether a formed containment remains stable
without continual external input.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Single collapsed core present
- No new energy injected
- No gravity or expansion mechanics

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Observe containment over time.
2. Track drift, decay, or dispersal.
3. Monitor shell persistence.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Containment remains stable.
- No spontaneous expansion.
- No decay without rule-based cause.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Containment is self-sustaining
✔ Stability emerges from structure

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Continuous energy input required
✘ Inevitable decay without gravity

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Containment disperses
- Structure dissolves spontaneously

STATUS:
PASSED
