TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 11 — Multi-Core Interaction and Coexistence

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To test whether multiple collapse cores can coexist within a single
containment without destructive interference.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Two or more collapse cores present
- Shared outer containment
- No gravity or attraction terms

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Allow independent collapse at separate locations.
2. Observe interaction zones.
3. Track dominance, migration, or stabilization.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Cores coexist without annihilation.
- Field-mediated spacing emerges.
- One core may dominate energetically without destroying others.
- Stable multi-core architecture persists.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Multi-core systems are stable
✔ Interaction is field-mediated, not collisional
✔ Hierarchy emerges naturally

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Inevitable merger
✘ Gravitational capture necessity
✘ Singular-only systems

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Cores merge uncontrollably
- System destabilizes
- Only one core can exist

STATUS:
PASSED
