# UQLT Test 06: Full-Scale Field Coherence Validation

## Test Title:
Cross-Scale Synchronization of Electromagnetic Containment Fields — Universal Coherence Check

## Objective:
To test the UQLT prediction that electromagnetic containment fields — from atomic to planetary to stellar — maintain **coherent phase relationships** due to shared substrate interaction and resonance locking.

## Hypothesis:
All active containment systems are nested and **phase-synchronized** through a shared frequency substrate. This coherence is **not emergent** from individual particle dynamics but reflects large-scale harmonic alignment across field layers.

## Methodology:
1. Identify systems across scale:
   - Atomic-scale EM containment (e.g., quantum well or trap systems)
   - Biological field structures (e.g., heart-brain EM measurements)
   - Planetary magnetic fields
   - Stellar coronal field oscillations

2. Compare measurable field parameters:
   - Frequency harmonics (Hz, GHz, etc.)
   - Phase-lock signatures
   - Delayed or instantaneous coupling effects

3. Determine presence of:
   - Nonlocal synchronization
   - Standing wave harmonics across nested systems

## Required Equipment:
- SQUID detectors (for biological and planetary EM signatures)
- Spectrometers (for atomic/stars)
- Data sets from satellite magnetometers, quantum lab equipment, and biosignal monitors

## Prediction:
- Phase harmonics show **nested coherence**
- Biological EM fields resonate within planetary field cycles
- EM emissions from atomic structures reflect macro-field alignment patterns

## Result Utility:
- Confirms UQLT’s multi-scale EMN~Q~CF field model
- Replaces random field fluctuation theories with structured coherence
- Establishes substrate-based coupling as the universal field synchronizer
