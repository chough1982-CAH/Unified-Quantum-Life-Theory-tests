TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 04 — Chronocollapse Time-Rate Gradient

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that time-rate differences arise from collapse gradients,
not velocity or spacetime curvature.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Stable containment with defined core
- Clock-rate proxies at multiple radii

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Measure rate differences vs radius.
2. Compare inner vs outer regions.
3. No velocity term applied.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Inner regions exhibit slower clock rates.
- Gradient matches collapse intensity.
- No dependence on motion.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Time is emergent
✔ Collapse sets clock rate

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Velocity-based time dilation
✘ Spacetime curvature necessity

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Clock rate correlates only with velocity
- No gradient appears

STATUS:
PASSED
