# Unified-Quantum-Life-Theory-tests
Official testing framework for Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT), authored by Clayton Andrew Houghland (CH[200625]). Includes timestamped test protocols validating core mechanisms: ChronoCollapse, Valignity, C‑Shift, EMN layering, biological symmetry, and field coherence.
# Unified Quantum Life Theory — Testing Framework

This repository contains the formal testing protocol archive for UQLT (Unified Quantum Life Theory), authored by Clayton Andrew Houghland [CH200625].

## Scope
Each test is independently timestamped, structurally documented, and aligned with UQLT’s core scientific claims. All tests are original works designed for empirical or simulation-based validation of:

- ChronoCollapse time differentials
- Redshift reinterpretation (C-Shift)
- EMN field layering and collapse behavior
- Orbital field containment
- Fusion decay product pathways
- Full-scale field coherence tests
- Biological symmetry alignment with universal field models
