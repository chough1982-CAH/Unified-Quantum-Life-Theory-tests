TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 07 — Shell Differentiation and Nesting

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that recursive collapse produces distinct, layered shells
rather than blended or unstable structures.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Primary and secondary cores present
- Recursive containment established
- No gravity or expansion terms

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Identify boundary regions of each containment.
2. Track interaction between inner and outer shells.
3. Monitor stability and separation over time.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Clear boundary separation between shells.
- Inner shell does not disrupt outer shell.
- Each shell maintains independent stability.
- Layering persists without oscillation or decay.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Nested shells form naturally
✔ Containments are non-destructive
✔ Layering is ordered, not chaotic

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Collapse destroys prior structure
✘ Single-shell universes
✘ Mixing without boundaries

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Shells merge uncontrollably
- Boundaries cannot be identified
- Instability propagates outward

STATUS:
PASSED
