TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 13 — Energy Throughput and Saturation

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To determine whether collapse cores have finite energy throughput
capacity and how excess energy is handled.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Stable containment with active core
- Increasing external energy input
- No artificial caps applied

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Gradually increase energy flow into containment.
2. Measure core intake rate.
3. Observe redistribution or secondary structure formation.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Core intake saturates at a finite rate.
- Excess energy redistributes outward.
- Secondary structures may form under sustained load.
- No infinite density occurs.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Finite containment capacity
✔ Saturation precedes instability
✔ Excess energy drives new structure

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Infinite-density singularities
✘ Unlimited energy absorption
✘ Numerical divergence as physical necessity

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Energy intake grows without bound
- Core density diverges
- System destabilizes catastrophically

STATUS:
PASSED
