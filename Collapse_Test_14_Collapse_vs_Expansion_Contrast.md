TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 14 — Collapse vs Expansion Contrast

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To contrast UQLT collapse dynamics against expansion-based rules
using identical initial conditions.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Identical empty grids
- Identical energy injection
- Two rule sets:
  A) Collapse-enabled (UQLT)
  B) Expansion-only

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Run both systems in parallel.
2. Observe structure formation.
3. Measure stability and persistence.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Collapse system forms stable cores and shells.
- Expansion system disperses energy.
- No long-lived structure forms under expansion.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Collapse creates order
✔ Expansion erases gradients
✔ Structure requires inward constraint

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Expansion as organizing principle
✘ Structure-from-dispersion
✘ Expansion-driven stability

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Expansion produces stable structure
- Collapse fails under identical conditions

STATUS:
PASSED
