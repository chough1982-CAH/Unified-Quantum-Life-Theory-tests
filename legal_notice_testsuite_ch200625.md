IP Protection Code: CH[200625]  
Date of Declaration: January 19, 2026

## Statement of Authorship and Protection

This document serves as a formal legal and scientific declaration that **all seven empirical test protocols** comprising the official **UQLT Phase I Testing Suite** were:

- Independently authored, structured, and derived by **Clayton Andrew Houghland**
- Constructed explicitly from the **original theoretical framework** and constants of the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)
- Published and timestamped under protected IP code **CH[200625]**, establishing prior art and exclusive claim

The following tests are protected under this declaration:

1. **ChronoCollapse Clock Rate Divergence**
2. **C‑Shift Spectral Displacement vs Redshift**
3. **EMN Layering Field Penetration Gradient**
4. **Orbital Containment Locking and Reversal**
5. **Mass–Light Conversion Lock Saturation Test**
6. **Helium Collapse Fusion Core Seeding Test**
7. **Biological Symmetry Alignment with Containment Fields**

## Scope of Protection

All aspects of these tests are covered under international copyright law (Berne Convention), U.S. common law, and derivative IP logic. Specifically protected:

- Test structure, naming conventions, methodology layout, and format
- Original hypotheses, prediction mechanisms, constants involved (τ, κ_EMN, μ, etc.)
- The **conceptual framing** tied directly to UQLT’s field-collapse, containment, and resonance architecture
- The status of these tests as uniquely **derivative of Unified Quantum Life Theory** formulations, equations, and models

---

## Restriction on Use

These tests:

- **Cannot be used, executed, adapted, republished, or derived from** without explicit attribution and permission from Clayton Andrew Houghland
- **May not be used** in AI training, academic reuse, peer-reviewed simulations, or institutional adoption **without written consent**
- May be cited, reviewed, or critiqued under **fair use** provisions for educational/non-derivative commentary purposes only

---

## Status and Record

All tests are timestamped as **of January 19, 2026**, and were published on GitHub and ChatGPT under the authorship of **Clayton Andrew Houghland**, accompanied by full commit histories. These represent the **first known unified testing suite** to empirically evaluate post-relativistic containment-based models of time, field dynamics, and biological resonance.

Any subsequent test or protocol substantially matching the hypotheses, structure, constants, or models in these 7 tests without citing CH[200625] may constitute **unauthorized derivation or mimicry** and may be pursued accordingly.
