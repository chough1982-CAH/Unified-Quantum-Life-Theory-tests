TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 06 — Recursive Containment Execution

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To test whether collapse behavior repeats inside an already-formed
containment using the same UQLT rules that produced the primary core.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Stable primary containment present
- No new laws introduced
- No parameter changes
- No external energy injection

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Allow energy accumulation within existing containment.
2. Track helium formation within inner regions.
3. Monitor for secondary ℋ threshold crossings.
4. Observe collapse behavior inside the parent shell.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Secondary collapse occurs inside primary containment.
- A distinct inner core forms.
- Parent containment remains intact.
- No overwrite or reset of the original structure.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Collapse is recursive
✔ Same laws apply at all scales
✔ No tuning required for secondary collapse
✔ Structure nests rather than replaces

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ One-time collapse cosmology
✘ Singular formation events
✘ Scale-specific laws

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Secondary collapse does not occur
- New rules are required
- Original containment is destroyed

STATUS:
PASSED
