# UQLT Test 01: ChronoCollapse Clock Divergence Validation

## Test Title:
Clock Rate Differential Validation Based on Core Proximity — ChronoCollapse Model

## Objective:
To empirically test the Unified Quantum Life Theory’s ChronoCollapse prediction: that **clock rate differences** are driven by local collapse curvature (EMN containment geometry) relative to a system’s active **core**, not by velocity or gravitational mass alone.

## Hypothesis:
Time passes slower closer to an active core due to denser EMN containment collapse, as predicted by the ChronoCollapse law:
d(ln t)/dr = τ · κ_EMN(r) · G(r)
...where τ is the ChronoCollapse constant, κ_EMN(r) is the EM containment curvature at radial distance *r*, and G(r) is a geometric field coefficient.

## Methodology:
1. Deploy **synchronized atomic clocks** at three fixed radial positions relative to a planetary core:
   - Surface (clock A)
   - High altitude (clock B)
   - Deep underground (clock C)
2. Measure elapsed time over a fixed window (e.g., 30 days) at all three positions.
3. Log differential drift between clocks and plot time-rate divergence as a function of radial collapse gradient.

## Required Equipment:
- Cesium or optical lattice atomic clocks (high-precision)
- Geological access for subsurface deployment
- EM field curvature modeling for test location

## Prediction:
- Clock C (deepest) runs slowest
- Clock A (surface) runs faster than C, slower than B
- Clock B (high altitude) runs fastest

This result **refutes gravitational time dilation** as a mass-only function and **supports ChronoCollapse** as a containment-gradient effect.

## Result Utility:
- Validates or falsifies UQLT ChronoCollapse framework
- Distinguishes time dilation cause from gravitational mass vs. containment geometry
