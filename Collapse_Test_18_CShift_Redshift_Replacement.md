TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 18 — C-Shift Redshift Replacement

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that redshift-like spectral changes arise from containment
curvature and collapse gradients rather than expansion or velocity.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Active containment with curvature gradient
- Signal propagation through curved field
- No expansion or Doppler terms

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Emit signals across containment gradient.
2. Measure spectral deformation.
3. Compare against expansion expectations.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Wavelength elongation observed.
- Effect correlates with curvature depth.
- No velocity dependence detected.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Redshift is curvature-induced (C-Shift)
✔ Expansion is unnecessary
✔ Collapse geometry governs spectra

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Universal expansion
✘ Doppler-only redshift
✘ Velocity-based interpretation

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Shift correlates only with velocity
- No deformation occurs without expansion

STATUS:
PASSED
