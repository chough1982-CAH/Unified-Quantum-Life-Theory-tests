TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 08 — Failure Mode Stress Test

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To determine whether UQLT collapse dynamics produce runaway,
unbounded, or unstable behavior under stress conditions.

STRESS CONDITIONS TESTED:
- Excess local energy accumulation
- Multiple near-simultaneous ℋ crossings
- Irregular spatial energy distributions

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Force extreme but rule-compliant inputs.
2. Observe collapse response.
3. Monitor for divergence, oscillation, or system failure.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Collapse remains bounded.
- No infinite acceleration or expansion.
- System resolves into additional structure
  rather than destabilizing.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Collapse is self-limiting
✔ Structure absorbs stress
✔ No runaway singularities form

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Infinite-density singularities
✘ Unbounded collapse
✘ Numerical instability inherent to recursion

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Collapse diverges without bound
- System oscillates indefinitely
- Structure cannot stabilize

STATUS:
PASSED
