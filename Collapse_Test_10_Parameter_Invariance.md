TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 10 — Parameter Invariance Proof

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that collapse outcomes do not depend on fine-tuned parameters,
grid resolution, or initial noise conditions.

VARIATIONS TESTED:
- Grid size scaling (small to large)
- Initial random energy noise
- Resolution changes
- Time-step variation

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Run identical collapse rules under varied parameters.
2. Compare resulting structure and stability.
3. Track core formation and shell geometry.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Collapse occurs in all parameter regimes.
- Core formation persists regardless of scale.
- Shell geometry remains consistent.
- No tuning required.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Laws dominate outcomes
✔ No hidden constants required
✔ Behavior is scale-invariant

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Fine-tuned initial conditions
✘ Fragile cosmological setups
✘ Parameter-dependent structure

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Collapse only occurs under specific tuning
- Structure degrades with scale
- Results diverge unpredictably

STATUS:
PASSED
