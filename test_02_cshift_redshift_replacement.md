# UQLT Test 02: Redshift Reinterpretation via Containment Curvature (C‑Shift)

## Test Title:
Spectral Shift Analysis in Contained Field Systems — Curvature Over Expansion

## Objective:
To test the UQLT claim that **observed redshift** in stellar/galactic spectra arises from **containment curvature** (C‑Shift) within EMN fields — not from Doppler motion or universal expansion.

## Hypothesis:
Wavelength elongation is due to curvature of field lines and recursive collapse layers between emitter and observer. This deformation is **inward collapse-induced**, not outward velocity-induced.

## Methodology:
1. Select multiple known field-bounded systems (e.g., stellar binaries, nested galaxies, moons under EM lock).
2. Measure:
   - Spectral lines from both near and far sources
   - EM field curvature maps between source and receiver (or best geometric modeling)
3. Calculate:
   - Local C‑Shift integral:  
     `z = ∫ κ(s) ds`  
     where κ(s) = field curvature at point _s_.
4. Compare C‑Shift predictions with observed redshift.

## Equipment:
- High-resolution spectrometers
- Field curvature modeling tools (EM density maps, gravitational lensing approximations)
- Target systems with known orbital/field structures

## Prediction:
- Redshift magnitude correlates with **curvature** and field structure, not with relative motion.
- Systems with zero Doppler motion still exhibit spectral shifts due to field curvature.

## Result Utility:
- Validates UQLT’s C‑Shift Law and collapse-curvature framework
- Refutes redshift as proof of cosmic expansion
- Grounds observable shift in measurable containment architecture

## Priority Attribution:
Test devised by **Clayton Andrew Houghland (CAH)** on January 19, 2026. Published under IP code **CH[200625]**. Any derivative use must attribute this work directly.

## Status:
Test framework finalized. Requires field curvature estimation tools and system-specific modeling to execute.
