TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 15 — Valignity vs Mass Attraction

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To test whether ordering, fall, and equilibrium behavior emerge from
Valignity (constraint-based ordering) rather than mass attraction.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Stable containment with medium density gradient
- Objects of varying density introduced
- No gravity or attraction terms enabled

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Insert objects at identical positions.
2. Observe motion relative to density layers.
3. Compare behavior to mass-attraction expectations.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Objects migrate based on density relation to medium.
- Neutral hover occurs at matching density bands.
- No universal downward acceleration exists.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Ordering arises from Valignity
✔ Hover bands emerge naturally
✔ Mass does not control acceleration

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Universal mass attraction
✘ Mass-dependent fall rates
✘ Gravity as primitive cause

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- All objects accelerate identically downward
- Hover equilibrium cannot form
- Mass dominates behavior

STATUS:
PASSED
