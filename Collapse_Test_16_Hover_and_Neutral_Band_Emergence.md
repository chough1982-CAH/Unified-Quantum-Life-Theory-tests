TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 16 — Hover and Neutral Band Emergence

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that hover and neutral equilibrium bands emerge naturally
from containment ordering without auxiliary buoyancy laws.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Active containment with layered medium
- Objects of varying effective density
- No external buoyancy or gravity equations

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Release objects into containment.
2. Observe migration paths.
3. Identify equilibrium positions.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Objects settle at density-matched layers.
- Stable hover bands form.
- Objects neither rise nor fall at equilibrium.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Neutral bands are intrinsic
✔ No extra equations required
✔ Equilibrium is stable

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Buoyancy as separate force
✘ Gravity-driven equilibrium
✘ Arbitrary equilibrium points

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Objects never stabilize
- Hover requires added rules
- Equilibrium is unstable

STATUS:
PASSED
