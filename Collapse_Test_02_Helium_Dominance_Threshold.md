TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 02 — Helium Dominance Threshold (ℋ)

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that collapse is triggered exclusively by helium dominance,
not by temperature, pressure, or gravitational attraction.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Energy decay allowed
- Helium accumulation enabled
- No gravity or pressure terms present
- ℋ defined as sole collapse trigger

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Energy decays into helium.
2. Helium accumulates locally.
3. When ℋ is exceeded, collapse initiates automatically.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- No collapse below ℋ.
- Immediate collapse upon exceeding ℋ.
- Collapse location matches helium peak.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Helium is the collapse trigger
✔ Collapse is threshold-based
✔ Timing is deterministic

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Thermal runaway requirement
✘ Mass-density attraction
✘ External compression

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Collapse occurs without helium
- Temperature alone triggers collapse
- Collapse timing varies arbitrarily

STATUS:
PASSED
