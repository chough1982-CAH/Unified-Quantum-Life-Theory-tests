TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 12 — Dominance Ordering Law

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To verify that when multiple collapse cores exist, a natural dominance
ordering emerges based on energy throughput and containment depth,
not gravitational attraction.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Multiple stable cores within shared containment
- Different energy accumulation rates
- No gravity or mass-attraction terms

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Allow cores to evolve under identical rules.
2. Measure relative energy throughput.
3. Observe ordering, influence radius, and stabilization.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- One core becomes dominant based on higher throughput.
- Secondary cores stabilize in subordinate roles.
- No forced merging or attraction occurs.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Dominance is emergent, not imposed
✔ Ordering is field-based
✔ Hierarchies form without attraction

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Mass-based dominance
✘ Distance-only hierarchy
✘ Inevitable mergers

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Dominance cannot be established
- Ordering requires attraction forces
- Cores merge to resolve hierarchy

STATUS:
PASSED
