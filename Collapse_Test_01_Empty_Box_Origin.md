TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 01 — Empty Box Origin

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To test whether structured systems can emerge from an initially empty
domain using only UQLT-defined laws, without gravity, expansion,
or preloaded mass.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Grid initialized to EMPTY
- No mass, no gravity, no spacetime curvature
- Only UQLT rules active:
  • Energy accumulation
  • Helium Dominance Threshold (ℋ)
  • Collapse rule
  • Containment formation

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Energy accumulates locally through rule-based propagation.
2. Energy decay produces helium.
3. When helium concentration exceeds ℋ, collapse initiates.
4. Collapse produces a stable containment core.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- A dominant core forms spontaneously.
- Surrounding structure organizes inward.
- System does not remain homogeneous.
- Collapse is inward, not explosive.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Structure emerges without pre-existing mass
✔ Collapse precedes order
✔ Core forms before shells
✔ No expansion required

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Big Bang expansion necessity
✘ Gravity as primitive cause
✘ Random uniform persistence

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- No core forms
- Collapse disperses outward
- Structure requires injected parameters

STATUS:
PASSED
