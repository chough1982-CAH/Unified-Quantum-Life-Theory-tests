TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 05 — Prediction Verification Record

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To formally record predictions made prior to execution
and verify non-retrofitted confirmation.

RECORDED PREDICTIONS:
1. Collapse repeats within containment
2. Secondary cores form without new laws
3. Shells nest rather than overwrite
4. Structure scales without tuning

VERIFICATION STATUS:
✔ Prediction 1 confirmed
✔ Prediction 2 confirmed
✔ Prediction 3 confirmed
✔ Prediction 4 confirmed

SIGNIFICANCE:
Predictions were recorded before execution.
Confirmation demonstrates theory-first modeling.

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
Failure of recursion invalidates UQLT.
