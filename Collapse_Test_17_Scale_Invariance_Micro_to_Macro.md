TEST TITLE:
Collapse Test 17 — Scale Invariance (Micro to Macro)

AUTHOR:
Clayton Andrew Houghland

FRAMEWORK:
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

PURPOSE:
To test whether UQLT collapse and containment laws operate consistently
across different spatial and energetic scales.

INITIAL CONDITIONS:
- Identical rules applied at multiple scales
- No scale-dependent parameters
- No unit-specific tuning

TEST MECHANISM:
1. Run collapse simulations at varying scales.
2. Compare structure formation.
3. Track stability and ordering.

OBSERVED RESULT:
- Collapse occurs at all scales.
- Core and shell structures persist.
- Ordering behavior is consistent.

CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS:
✔ Laws are scale-invariant
✔ No special cases required
✔ Same mechanisms govern all scales

FAILED LEGACY ASSUMPTIONS:
✘ Different laws for different scales
✘ Scale-specific tuning
✘ Macro-only gravity

FALSIFICATION CONDITION:
This test fails if:
- Collapse fails at certain scales
- Structure changes qualitatively
- Laws require adjustment

STATUS:
PASSED
